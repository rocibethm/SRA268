The darker the blue the higher the number is, while the lighter blue means the number is smaller. The orange bars represent the negative values.

For example this graph is showing us that this dataset is skewed a bit to the left. I created a histogram because it helps higlight the shape of the data. This makes it helpful because you are able to see when a graph is skewed to the right, left or its symmetric. I learned that in this graph you can tell that most of the wining points range from 49.7 to 106.5. Also keeping gaps between the bars helps view the distribution of the graph. "

While humans have the lowest percentage of winning points. The different proportions linked to a different color and percentage make the graph easy to understand, and for this reason pie charts are one of the most popular graphs to use when comparing different data.
